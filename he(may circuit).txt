Max. Marks: 100

You are given two numbers
and . Your task is to find the last digit of the following equation: 
X^(n!%10)
Input format

The first line contains two integers
and

.

Output format

Print the last digit of the given equation.

Constraints

SAMPLE INPUT

5 2

SAMPLE OUTPUT

5

Explanation

factorial of (2) is 2*1=2  ,So 5^2=25 the last digit in 25 is 5









x,n=map(int,input().split())
if n==0 or n==1:
    t=1
elif n==2:
    t=2
elif n==3:
    t=6
elif n==4:
    t=4
else:
     t=0
print(pow(x,t)%10)
